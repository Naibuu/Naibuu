# üëã Hi there!

My name is Alex. I'm a self-taught programmer and freelance worker from Greece, specializing in frontend development and design. Programming is a huge passion of mine, and I have been hooked for multiple years now.

The first lines of code I ever wrote were for a simple Discord bot I made using Python. This experience led me to create other silly projects, like Minecraft mods and clients, which really helped me understand how code works.

In 2021, I began making websites and haven't stopped since. I've created multiple websites and notable experiences for everyone. I am experienced with many important web frameworks, such as Vue, React, Svelte, and more.

# üìö Projects

You can view some of my projects that I starred by clicking [here](https://github.com/stars/Naibuu/lists/my-projects)!

I currently work with CheatBreaker, creating a brand new launcher with features unseen in any previous launchers. I also work on SkinBook, which is your typical NameMC clone but with much more profile customizability, all for free.

I previously worked on Hybris (formerly known as ~Solar Tweaks~). Please do not ask me questions about it, as I have moved on from that overall. I have also worked on a few Minecraft clients, such as Ember Client (cosmetics), Ranked Client (cosmetics & UI concepts), Noah's Melon Client (cosmetics), and some other clients which are not relevant, so I won't be listing them.
